## Abstract
In this paper the authors introduce the emulator, STITCHES, which uses existing
archives of Earth System Modelsâ€™ (ESMs) scenario experiments to construct new scenarios, or enrich existing initial condition ensembles. This repository archives the data and scripts used in the experimental setup and analysis for the manuscript.

## Contributing modeling software
| Model | Version | Repository Link | DOI |
|-------|---------|-----------------|-----|
| STITCHES | v0.9.0 pre-release | https://github.com/jgcri/stitches | https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6463264 |


## Workflow

1. Install the software components required to conduct the experiment from [STITCHES](https://github.com/jgcri/stitches#getting-started-using-stitches)
2. Run the following scripts in the `workflow` directory to re-create the manuscript experiments:
    * A scripts that use STITCHES to emulate ESMs 
    * AB scripts that produce STITCHES outputs and processes them for the manuscript
    * B scripts process, analyze, and visualize A outputs for the manuscript
    * NOTE: paths to input and output directories may have to be updated in the scripts.


| Script Name | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| `A.inital_cond_exp.py` | Script that emulates ssp245 & ssp370 GSAT at different tolerance and target ensemble sizes | 
| `A.tas_psl_pr.py` | Script that produces gridded outputs for ssp245 & ssp370 joint tas-ps-psl products | 
| `A.intermediate_exp.py` | Script that emulates intermediate scenarios using ssp126 and ssp585 runs as the archive, GSAT outputs  | 
| `AB.experiment_tolerance_sweep.py` | Script that emulates intermediate scenarios using all available CMIP6 runs over a range of tolerances and calculates error statistics, GSAT outputs and summary statistics outputs  | 
| `B.ICEnsembles_ESD.r` | Script evaluating the outputs of `A.inital_cond_exp.py`, calculating error statistics and plotting results | 
| `B.IntermediateScenarios_GSAT_ESD.r` | Script evaluating the outputs of `A.intermediate_exp.py`, calculating error statistics and plotting results | 
| `B.IntermediateScenarios_Gridded_ESD.r` | Script evaluating the outputs of `A.tas_psl_pr.py`, calculating SOI and error statistics and plotting results |
